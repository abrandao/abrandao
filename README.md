### Hi there! Nice to see you here.

# My name is Anderson Brandão. I am just a Ruby Developer from São Paulo, Brazil.

I mostly do web development in Ruby and Javascript but still curious about a lot of other languages and technologies in general. My past experiences include PHP, HTML5, CSS3, Linux, Docker and platforms like Wordpress. Now I am working at [app.estimulo.com](https://app.estimulo2020.org/) using my favorite tools like Ruby, Heroku, Semaphore, git, javascript and more...

I'm avaiable for hire to face-to-face or remote work.
